            "content": "DNA is a nucleic acid molecule that is used to store information within cells. This information is stored in a sequence of nucleotides which are the building blocks of DNA. . Every cell, in a multicellular organism, has more or less the same DNA, except for mutations that happens. But generally, every cell will have the same DNA, but every cell is doing kind of different thing. There is difference not so much in the content of DNA in each cell, but there is difference in regulation of what parts of DNA will be used. Important regulation of function of DNA is the way, how DNA is organised in cell. . Double helix . DNA forms double helix. It is the first way that DNA is organised. There are two strands of DNA that have the same information but nucleotides on one strand are complementary to nucleotides on the other strand. Complementary means that A pairs with T and G with C. This is called canonical (or Watson-Crick) pairing. This complementarity has to do with chemical properties of nucleotides. . . It is not physically impossible to create different pair, but it is energetically unfavourable. These different pairings are called non-canonical pairing. Example might be G-quadruplexes. There are 4 guanines (G) in the same plane that somehow pair all together and result is quite stable. Nucleotides can also be modified in many ways and this modification are also changing their pairing properties. . . Nucleosome . Accessibility of DNA is achieved thanks to nucleosomes. The structure of a nucleosome consists of a short part of DNA wound around eight histone proteins. This structure resembles thread wrapped around a spool. . . Histone proteins have small parts sticking out of main structure of nucleosome and these parts can be chemically modified. Histone modifications is a whole language that is describing packing of a DNA based on what each part of DNA does. Examples of meaning of different modifications are: . here is the beginning of a gene, | this whole area contains a gene, | here is the end of a gene, | here is some regulatory region. | . . Histone modifications is very important way of how cell regulate which parts of DNA will be open and which parts will be closed. . Chromosome . Chromosomes, as they are often shown in pictures (looking like X) is form of DNA that only exists when cell is getting to process of replication and it already replicated its chromosomes. In that moment, in human cell, there are 92 chromosomes in 46 pairs. Arms of this X-like molecule are 2 copies of the same chromosome stuck together. After replication of cell, each copy will go into one daughter cell. . In other normal operating states of cell, DNA has more loose formation that is called chromatin. In nucleus, there are string of DNA all over. Parts of DNA are more condense and other parts are more open. This depends on what parts need to be transcribed and what parts need to be silenced. . Centromere and telomere . There are two special parts of chromosome: centromere and telomere. Centromere is the point in the middle where two copies of chromosome attach to each other during replication. Because of these reasons, there are not much genes in centromere. . . Telomeres are at the ends of chromosomes. Every time chromosome is copied, there is a chance that small part at the end will not get copied. Chromosome is getting shorter and shorter with each cell division. At the end of chromosome is this part called telomere that is containing a lot of unimportant information (in terms of genes and regulatory sequences) and acts as buffer. When this part doesn’t get copied perfectly and gets shortened, cell doesn’t loose any important information. Cell also has some mechanisms that are able to add random sequences at the end of chromosomes - they elongate telomeres. . . Telomeres and shortening of chromosomes is connected with ageing. As organism ages, cells get replicated enough times that telomeres become shorter and shorter and eventually cells start to loose ends of chromosomes that actually contains some genes. At this point cell starts failing. Function of telomeres is also associated with cancer. There is this mechanism of cell to die after some number of divisions for a reason. Replication of DNA is not a perfect process, there can be introduced some mutations - wrong nucleotide is in daughter cell. After some time this mutations accumulate and since function of DNA is very complicated, there is much higher probability, that mutation will harm the cell than that it will help the cell (and also some mutation will do just nothing). So telomeres get shorter with each division, mutations accumulate with each division and after some number of division it is in the best interest of organism as whole for cell to die. But in case of some cancers, these telomeres are not getting shorter and cell becomes immortal. . Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes . Prokaryotic organisms also have DNA, but their DNA is not as big and not packed as tightly as in more complex organisms. Mostly, these organisms have one chromosome (which is usually circular) and then they might have some other smaller circular molecules of DNA called plasmids. . . Prokaryotes have multiple chromosomes. That means that DNA is not one continuous sequence of nucleotides, but is separated into multiple sequences - chromosomes. Humans have 46 chromosomes, so within each human cell, there are 46 chromosomes. Each of these chromosomes has its own sequence (paired chromosomes have similar sequences (coding the same genes), but still not the same, because they are from different parent and might contain different alleles of genes). . .",

            "content": "Most of the organisms on Earth have just one cell and whole self sufficient organism is contained in it. In higher multicellular organisms such as plants, humans etc., there is a specialisation of cells - different cells might do a specific job - and all of them together are needed for organism to survive. Even single cell is dependent on products of different cell types to survive. . Building blocks of cells . In general, all cells across all types of organisms and all kingdoms are made out of the same very basic ingredients. In very broad terms, we can divide them into 3 main categories: lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. . Molecules from all of these broad categories are made up from smaller molecules. One of these small molecules are called amino acids and when many amino acids come together they produce a protein. Another small molecule is phospholipid and when many molecules - many lipids - come together, they can form a membrane for example. The same with with sugars. We have small glucose molecule and then many glucose molecules can form a big molecules like starch, glycogen or cellulose. . Generally, when we’re talking about building blocks of life, we’re talking about these bigger molecules - macromolecule. Smaller molecules exist in cells as well, but the majority of molecules that are used in life, are these bigger macromolecules. . Proteins . Pretty much behind anything that happens in a cell is a protein. Like 99% of the things that happen in the cell is done by a protein. Proteins are building blocks, proteins are tools, proteins are kind of workhorse of the cell. . Chemically, proteins are made of 20 building blocks called amino acids, that all have different forms and chemical properties. Some amino acids for example like water, some hate water, some are positively or negatively charged etc. . . Amino acids are organised in long chains. This long chain of amino acids, or multiple chains coming together, is called protein. The way that these chains of amino acids are arranged is based on their chemical properties. This long chain will somehow fold in space. Some parts want to go inside, some parts want to go outside to be closer to water, some parts may hate each other and repel if they’re both positively charged. All this interactions will form shape of protein in space. . . What is even more interesting is that based on manipulations (maybe something can come in and charge atom in a protein) there can be moving parts in a protein. . . Function of the protein is defined by its 3D structure - way the protein folds in space. This process of protein folding is big question in biology and we still haven’t figured out exact rules how proteins folds. Folding mostly depends on sequence of amino acids (and their chemical properties), but will also depends on the conditions under which protein folds. . There are also other proteins, other tools, that come in and and try to force proteins to fold in a specific way. Other proteins are part of machinery, that is doing quality control of proteins. It checks proteins and if they are misfolded, it can destroy them, unfold them to give them second chance to fold or dismantles them into amino acids and then they can be used somewhere else. But generally, the idea is that by large, sequence of amino acids defines how proteins will fold. Recently, there was a huge breakthrough with the deep learning on this protein folding problem. . . Lipids (fats) . Lipids are defining cell in space. If we think of a cell as as a kind of balloon, that is floating in a liquid, the outside part of the balloon is mostly made out of lipids. If you take a jar and you put water in it and then you put a little bit of oil in it and then you shake the jar, you’re gonna get this little lipid bubbles inside. . . How are these bubbles formed and how they persist in water? The answer to that comes from chemical properties of lipids. Lipid has a head and tail. Different lipids have different forms but this is kind of a generalised view of lipid. . . Head and tail have very different, very specific, chemical characteristic. The head likes water and tail really hates water. . . When there are many of these molecules forced to mix with water, they will came together to form a structure, where heads will be facing water and tails will be hidden. They will form this sphere with two layers, or better said, with bilayer. This bilayer has heads on the both sides, since they like contact with water and tails are hidden in the middle and came in contact only with other tails. There is water both inside and outside and that’s why it’s a bilayer. . . When it comes to cells we think about lipids as building blocks of membranes. All cells have a cell membrane made out of this double layer. There are other highly specialised parts of cells that do different jobs. This parts are called organelles and they also have lipid layer (either bilayer or single layer). . Carbohydrates (sugars) . Sugars are molecules that don’t like to change conformation very quickly. In this terms, if something has to do with sugars, it will be something structural or it has to do with long term storage of energy. . Nucleic acids (DNA + RNA) . We mention here also nucleic acids. They create just small percentage of cells, but they are still very important for function of cells. . Cell types . There are two different types of cells - prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. . . Prokaryotic . Prokaryotic cells are less complex and they almost completely lack internal organelles. They still have their outside membrane and other protective layers outside made out of sugars, but inside the cell, they do not really have exact organelles. This doesn’t mean that they don’t have complex biology, they are just not very complexly organised inside cells. One organelle that prokaryotes have is ribosome. In that sense, it’s kind of the most basic organelle that is needed for life. Bacteria and other microorganism are prokaryotic. . Eukaryotic . Generally they are much bigger than prokaryotic cells and they have much more internal organisation. Cells come in many different shapes and forms and they might contain many different specialised organelles. . Nucleus . Nucleus is surrounded by lipid membrane - nucleus membrane. Inside nucleus, there is stored DNA of the cell. DNA is in very compacted structure, but there are mechanisms to open certain parts of DNA and transcribe them into RNA. Transcription happens in nucleus and RNA is then transported through membrane into cytoplasm, finding its way through endoplasmic reticulum, getting various modification, until it finds ribosome. . Membrane . Every living cell has a lipid bilayer surrounding it. Lipids in this bilayer are very tightly packed together, but an important characteristic of this structure is that some very very small molecules can pass through. So it’s not a completely tight barrier. . . Cell membrane is not created by lipids themselves. Embedded in cell membrane, there are proteins. They can create a channel between inside of the cell and surrounding of the cell and let pass some molecules through it. There are many of these proteins in the cell membrane that are specific about which molecules they’ll they let pass. Another very common protein on the cell membrane is a protein that has a sensor outside. It senses something outside the cell and then sends a signal inside. . Ribosome . Job of the ribosome is to translate RNA to protein. Since proteins are tools that build almost everything in the cell, we cannot have cell without ribosomes to produce these proteins. Ribosome is this rRNA-protein complex that holds mRNA and attracts tRNAs. tRNA are reading three nucleotides from mRNA and translating them into one amino acid. These amino acids create chain that is protein. . . Mitochondria . Mitochondria are pretty interesting organelles. Mitochondria are the only other part of the cell that has its own DNA completely different from the one in the nucleus. They have outer double membrane, its own inner membrane, own ribosomes and they produce some proteins. If we look at it a little bit more, it looks a lot like a prokaryotic cell. . . Current theories are, that mitochondria were prokaryotic cells, that were eaten by eukaryotic cell millions years ago. Instead of being digested, they got encased in a membrane and they started functioning together, being valuable for the cell and then they became an organelle. . Mitochondria produce energy. They are kind of a chemical factory - they burn chemicals and produce energy. But how is this energy stored in cells? Cells absorb energy and build structure. They can get this energy from many sources - breaking chemical bonds, sun, temperature, oxidising metals, etc. However, this energy cannot be always used the moment it was produced and it needs to be stored. In cells, energy is largely stored inside phosphate bond for quick access (or as carbohydrate of lipid for longer term). . There is this molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which has three phosphates. This ATP can be converted to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and then back to ATP. When three goes to two, phosphate goes away and energy is released. If energy is put into it, s phosphate can be added. This is called the energetic currency of the cell. . . Lets look at visualization of mitochondria in action. . Another interesting fact about mitochondria is its passing to the offspring in higher organisms, that have sexual reproduction. Female and male gametes are coming together to produce the embryo. Usually, we have egg and sperm. Sperm are very tiny and spend all their energy on moving. They are really tightly packed because if the are moving more efficient they will more easily survive. They don’t have space for mitochondria. In contrast, egg is really big and it basically just stays in one place. Mitochondria gets passed to the next generation just by egg which means that mitochondrial DNA comes only from mother. . Chloroplast . Chloroplast is organelle similar to mitochondria in several areas: . it also came from event of absorbing prokaryotic cell, | it can also produce energy. | . Main difference is in a way, how chloroplast produces energy. They produce energy for the cell by absorbing light. Active substance that absorb light is called chlorophyll. It absorbs specific spectrum of light and store it into a chemical form - into ATP. Another difference is that chloroplast can be only found in plant cells and mitochondria in both plant and animal cells. . . Cytoskeleton . Cytoskeleton is a support structure inside cell that helps cell to keep its form to be able to function. Cytoskeleton takes different forms and it’s a very complex formation, but generally it takes the form of really strong really long filaments (like strings). They intersect in many different ways and they structurally support the weight of organelles. . . Sometimes we simplify cell to a blob of liquid where organelles swim inside, but reality is that cell is very tightly packed environment with many sub-cellular spaces, and the whole thing is tight together with this cytoskeleton rope. . A very important function of the cytoskeleton is in cell division. When cells divide, things need to be moved to different places and be organised. There is whole special program of how cytoskeleton rearranges itself to create this two parts that are tight on two ends of the cell. When these two new cells start to move apart, they need to pull the right amount of chromosomes and the right amount of organelles. . .",

            "title": "What is life?",
            "content": "Characteristics of living organisms . There is no one thing that separates living from not living. But we can find some key characteristics shared among all living organisms even tho lines are not exactly clear. . 1. Reproduction . Organism should be able to reproduce itself - make an approximate copy of itself. . Contra-example: We might have a computer program, that is able to reproduce itself, but it doesn’t necessarily makes it alive. . 2. Metabolism . Metabolism is a process of taking in one type of chemical and producing a different type of chemical. . Contra-example: We can take a bunch of chemicals and put them in a jar to make a system, that is able to take in for example sugar and produces protein. But it doesn’t necessarily means that this jar is alive. . 3. Homeostasis . Homeostasis is ability of living organisms to maintain their ideal internal conditions, such as temperature, pH, … . 4. Cells . At least life that we know on Earth (in a way biology understand life and define it) is organised in this units of structure called cells. . It might not be necessary for all life that could potentially exist to be packed in cells. But if we are talking about life that came from Earth’s conditions, we find it organises in cells. . Life as emergent property . We can see that none of characteristics by itself is enough, but we can try to combine them and look at them as a whole. . When we think about cells supported by homeostasis paired with metabolism, then life is creation of local environment with special ordering of chemical that protects this environment and has a mechanism for producing imperfect copies of this type of organisation. . Personal note: . I like to look at life as emergent behaviour. In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviours which emerge only when the parts interact. We can try to find simple characteristics of life, but it is not enough. Life emerges from interactions of those characteristics. . . When we are talking about obviously living things (like bacteria, plants, etc.), we will find them to be organised in cells and have some core of hereditary information, which is encoded in nucleic acids (at least on Earth). Hereditary information is essentially a blueprint how cell operates and reproduces. Combining this concept of having hereditary information with process of reproduction (which is imperfect process) we get an emergent property of evolution. . Grey area of life . As we don’t have strict definition for life, there is a grey area between alive and not alive. We can find viruses in this grey area. They have some local organisation but not cells. Main issue with viruses is that they don’t have their own metabolism, homeostasis and they cannot reproduce by themselves. Another grey area is transposable elements. Transposable element is a small piece of information (coded in a chemicals) that jump around and embed itself into another parts genetic information. It kind of has a live on its own. But it doesn’t fit other characteristics of life. Live or not alive, they have some life-like characteristics and we can consider them to be a subject studied in biology. .",

            "title": "Evolution",
            "content": "Imperfect copies as driver of evolution . Evolution is dependent on imperfect copies. If we had perfect reproduction, it would never evolve. . Imperfect copy . Term imperfect copy means that genetic information (DNA) from parent and offspring is not the same. These differences could be introduced in a process of making a copy of genetic information or there were some changes introduced during life of organism, before reproduction. . Evolvable programs . Speaking in programming terms (we can look at genetic information as program for creating an organism), we can have a program, that is able to copy itself and makes some small changes to own code while doing so. If we had a program that always copy itself perfectly, we would still have the same program, even if it runs for millions of years. . But if program would be able to randomly change small part of itself, there would be evolution. Wast majority of new programs would die (they wouldn’t be able to run), but some would survive and exist on their own and will create their own copies (containing changes they inherited and introducing their own changes in their offspring). . Resources of a computer are limited, so only the best programs would be able to run (and reproduce itself) and not so good programs would die. After some time, changes in code would accumulate in some instance of program and it might start doing something quite different from function of original parent program. . Personal note: . To see evolution in action, check some implementation of Richard Dawkins’s biomorphs. . It is simplified version of organism encoded in programming terms. This biomorph (organism) has 9 genes - variables influencing its width, height and branching depth. These 9 genes can be used to generate more than 118 billion different biomorphs. Humans, for comparison, have about 20,000 to 25,000 protein-coding genes. . You start with parent with some random values of genes. The children’s genes are identical to its parent’s genes except for a single mutation which changes its appearance slightly. You can select which child you want to become the parent in the next generation by clicking on it. By repeating this process, you can see how the biomorphs evolve over time. . Speeding up evolution . Since evolution is dependent on imperfect copies, a way to speed up this process is to use radiation. Radiation is known to disrupt genetic information - introduce mutations in DNA. If we would like to test many different mutations on a plant, we can take a bunch of seeds and irradiate them. Then can grow all of these seed and see if we introduced some beneficial changes (e.g. that plant will grow faster.) This is a way how GMO was done 30 years ago. . Imperfect copies in multicellular organisms . Single-cell organisms can create a copy of themselves to produce an offspring. But with multicellular organisms, it is more complicated. They are creating copies of their cells during whole life as part of growth and repair - new cells are still part of the same organisms. . In broad terms, genetic information (DNA) of an organism doesn’t change. Organism starts from one cell with some DNA and during development and whole life of organism, all cells have the same copy of DNA. . In closer look, there are many mechanisms, how is DNA in cells changed during lifetime: . every cell goes trough different effects from the environment (for example radiation), | every time DNA is copied, there is a chance of introducing a mistake in a copy, | every time DNA breaks (because of some physical tension, or some chemical that breaks it) there is a chance of mistake in repair, | there are viruses that can get into cell and put their DNA into DNA of cell, | there are parts of DNA that can be copied out and pasted to different part of DNA, by themselves (called transposable elements), … | . Genetic information (DNA) of a single organism will not drastically change within lifetime of one organism. Every cell can have some small changes, but in broad view we can say, that one part of an organism has the same DNA as any other part of this organism. Different function of cell is not because of different DNA in them, but it is due to regulation on top of DNA. . Harmful changes . Process of introducing changes to DNA during lifespan is connected with cancer. There are some cells in our body that accumulate enough of these changes in wrong places and then program of extreme proliferation is triggered (they grow, make many copies and they don’t die). They do not follow plan of organism as whole, but they proliferate on their own without following the rules of survival of organism. . Normal cells (healthy cells without cancer) have processes of quality control. Once genetic material in a normal cell changes too much so that cell is in danger of not functioning properly, they have a way to commit a suicide. For example, our skin does this all the time. Skin is the first line of defence for many things (like radiation from sun, chemicals, etc.) so skin cells are programmed in a way that they die fast and are replaced by cells from below. .",

            "title": "Regulation and development",
            "content": "Regulation . There are many types of cells with many different functions in multicellular organisms (just thinks about skin cells, red blood cells or neurone cell), but all these cells share the same DNA. There are multiple layers how DNA is guarding function of cell. . . Sequence of DNA is the base layer. But on top of DNA there are layers of regulation that says what parts of DNA should be active, which parts should be suppressed and how to decide in any point in time. This regulatory mechanism is big part of what biology and science is trying to figure out. . Example of one layer of regulation might be accessibility of DNA. We can imagine DNA as a book. And you could have some pages that are glued together and they’re really hard to open and there’s some pages that are almost half open. The pages that are almost half open are much easier to be copied. . Another layer is regulation after part of DNA is copied. Some part of DNA is half open so it can be copied, but later there is a level of regulation that can identify a specific signals and can destroy them or it can regulate how long they will exist. . Development of multicellular organisms . Every multicellular organism starts from one single cell. Cells are programmed to copy themselves to as much as possible perfect copies. There is a whole program of regulation of this process - which part of genome will be more accessible and which part will be almost hidden. This program is called development. It will bring the single cell to copy into 2 - 4 - 8 - etc. Their DNA will not change, but accessibility of DNA will start changing. Eventually, some of these cells will become head, other cells will become skin etc. They will all have different developmental programs. . When we’re talking about multicellular organisms, like plants or humans, we will have many developmental programs that need regulated in a very complex ways to function in a proper way and not cause harm. . Development in singe-cell organisms . In single-cell organisms (like bacteria), processes of development and evolution have not so clear boundaries. This organisms are also trying to make perfect copy of themselves. In simple terms it means, that they will: . absorb energy and chemical from environment, | copy their tools (parts of their cell), | copy their genetic information (DNA), | they will split into two (hopefully) exact copies. | . This two copies will continue in this process: absorbing - duplicating - splitting. It is similar to processes in multicellular organisms, but here new cells are not part of the same organism. . Simple cells have less regulation. They still do have complex regulation, but they have less programs how their cell should behave. When we were talking about bacteria, they need programs for absorbing energy and chemicals, for copying tools and genetic information and for splitting into two cells. But they also might have programs for behaviour for times when there is not enough food. .",
