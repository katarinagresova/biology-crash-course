## Replication

Replication means you take the whole DNA and you make a copy of the whole DNA.

## Transcription

Transcription is the production of RNA from DNA. But we are not transcribing the whole DNA. If we look at DNA as book that has open a certain page, something can came in and copy a passage from this book, just a little part. We can think of it as a little post note with a short text.

## Translation

Translation is production of protein from RNA. Notes crated by transcription can float away into other parts of cell where is machinery that can read text wrote on it. This text is like instruction for putting molecules together and building things.
