DNA is double stranded long molecule that is made out of 4 nucleotides - A, T, C, G.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is shorter single stranded molecule also made out 4 nucleotides, but this time it is - A, U, C, G. This U (uracil) nucleotide is RNA equivalent to T (thymine) nucleotide in DNA.
Proteins are also single stranded molecules but they are not made out of nucleotides. This is why process of producing protein based on RNA is called translation - we are translating into a completely different kind of chemical. Building blocks of proteins are called amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids that are used in living organisms that we know. There is many more amino acids as chemical molecules, but they're 20 that are used in in life.

## Genetic cod

We have and mRNA that has a signal that needs to be translated into protein. This mRNA is made out of 4 letters - A, U, C, G. We want to translate this into a protein that can be build out out 20 different amino acids. We need some mapping between 4 nucleotides and 20 amino acids. Obviously, we cannot do one-to-one mapping as we did with DNA to RNA transcription. The way how life got around this is to use triplets (kmers where k=3). Combining three RNA nucleotides together, we can make up to 64 different combinations (three position, 4 possible nucleotides, 4\*4\*4 = 64). These 64 possible combinations are used to encode 20 different amino acids plus some control signals (such as stop signal). This dictionary of triplets (called codons in here) versus amino acids is called the genetic code.
